        * A bank HAS customers
        * customers HAS accounts (Savings + Current)
        *
        *
        * We created the design so that a customer can be added to a bank even if the Accounts have not been instanciated yet
        * The method "SetAccounttoManagement" has to be called in order to update the list of managedAccount of the Bank
        * If we want to have a global view of a person, we ought to create a new class "Individual" composed of a list of "Customers"
        * Therefore, an "Individual" could have multiple current and savings accounts in multiple banks
        * Because the software is design for a given Bank; in "SetAccounttoManagement" all the accounts of a given customer are added to the managedAccount
